## Run (Local) and Deploy Commands

First run 
``git clone https://github.com/Geller99/YouGo-Backend-Track`` on your local drive in any directory

Then 
``npm i`` install required dependencies for node, AWS, multer, sharp etc

The Package.json file outlines the available commands for running this server locally

```
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn app.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "tsc && node dist/app.js"
  }
```

``npm run dev`` uses tsc-node-dev and the --respawn command to restart the server whenever chaanges are detected in the code base


## Docker Config

Make sure you have a running Docker Daemon, if not, install docker desktop
`https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/`

## Commands
```
Pass Environment variables directly via docker run:

docker run -p 3000:3000 -e VARIABLE_NAME=value yougo-backend-track


Pass .env file to docker via docker run command:

docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 yougo-backend-track

```

## Sample API Calls

Here's a couple examples using a tool like Insomnia/Postman to test the API on localhost

![Alt text](docs/images/image.png)

To Rotate an image 
```
file: [Attach your image file here]
angle: enter numerical angle here

```


![Alt text](docs/images/image-1.png)

To Resize an image
```
file: [Attach your image file here]
height: 600
width: 800

```
![Alt text](docs/images/image-2.png)


Define your URL and the specific endpoint you'd like to hit and voila!


## Users and Cloud Image Storage

Reveal API provides custom user storage via AWS S3 for users who wish to customize and store their images

When testing locally, you can attach your own S3 bucket and try out

```
/store, 
/fetchList, 
/fetchImage, 
/ManipulateStore 
```
These endpoints utilize S3 for image storage and retrieval

## Cleanup

When testing the API locally, images are stored in the public folder titled after whatever endpoint they were manipulated with

Remember to clear these periodically after local testing
