**My Official Backend Track**


## Topics and Challenges

Hey there! 

This repo contains my aggressive dive into Backend Engineering using Node Js and Express, 

The goal is to complete YouGoDev's Backend Track build by Google's ZenHorace, dive into Database Engineering and Finally into Distributed Systems with Golang

You can find the Track here! https://github.com/YouGoDevs/YouGo-Backend-Track/blob/main/Project-0.md

As part of my accountability process, I'll be updating this repo with articles from my learnings, sessions with our server mentors and key takeaways from my mistakes

My intention is to build this into a series for anyone looking to follow along this journey, so feel free to star this repo and stay connected!




## Design Documents

The above linked design document represents the QA section of the YouGo Backend Track,

It covers certain choices made by my engineering team (ME) and the reasons behind them

The goal is to have a full understanding of every piece of logic implemented and an explanation behind my decisions as I go

Take a read and let me know what you think!



## API Demo

To demo this API, head over to ``0xServer.heroku.app``

Here's a link to the Swagger API Documentation for more information on the different endpoints available

To clone this repo on your local environment

Head over to your terminal/command line and enter the command ``git clone "repoURL" `` 

Once you've successfully cloned it, enter ``npm i`` to install all dependencies and modules

Then switch over to the source directory and enter ``npm run dev`` or ``yarn dev``





## Testing and Documentation

The objective with testing is to establish a fundamnetal approach to software testing and CI/CD processes.

I'll be using the 3 As of testing as a guideline to building proper unit tests for my methods

Testing Framework ``Jest``




## Key Takeaways

This section will be updated with links to my medium, dev.to and hashnode as I document my mistakes, and learnings

Stay tuned!
